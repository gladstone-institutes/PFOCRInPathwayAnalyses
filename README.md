# PFOCRInPathwayAnalyses

1. I downloaded all the human data from the ARCHS4 database [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ae43cpingp8dpe6/human_matrix_download.h5?dl=0).
2. For pathway analyses we could start working with the [rSEA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rSEA/vignettes/rSEA_vignette.html) package.
